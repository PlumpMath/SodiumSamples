# PongSodium

This is a simple exercise implementing the game Pong with the [FRP library Sodium](https://github.com/SodiumFRP/sodium), using its [C# implementation](https://github.com/SodiumFRP/sodium/tree/master/c%23).
The purpose of this it to discuss the implementation and its weaknesses (which are certainly existing), learn Sodium together, and maybe find ways to improve the library.

Over time, more elaborated examples might follow.

Note that this implementation of Pong makes heavy use of the [Pong example provided by Elm](http://elm-lang.org/examples/pong).
Also, the user [Ziriax](https://github.com/Ziriax) made a significant contribution to how to move the paddles.
